# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This folder contains Terraform templates representing the proposed
secure AWS architecture described in Chapter 2 and implemented in Chapter 4.

Due to AWS Academy sandbox limitations, the infrastructure was deployed
manually via the AWS Management Console. These templates serve as a
conceptual and repeatable representation of the deployment.
